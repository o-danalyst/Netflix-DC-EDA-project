🎬 Netflix Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
![Overview](Visuals/readme_banner.png)
🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and exploring a **Netflix dataset** containing details about movies and TV shows available on the platform.
The goal is to understand trends in Netflix’s catalog — such as **content types, release patterns, country contributions, and popular directors** — while ensuring the data is clean and analysis-ready.

---

🎯 Objectives

. Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
. Identify and handle duplicates and missing values.
. Convert data types (e.g., dates) for consistency.
. Explore key business questions through EDA.

---

🧰 Tools & Libraries

1. Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2. Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`

---

🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Steps performed to prepare the dataset:

1. Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
2. Identified and summarized missing values.
3. Converted the `Release_Date` column to standard `datetime` format.
4. Dropped irrelevant columns and standardized categorical values.
5. Verified data types and ensured overall dataset consistency.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key exploratory queries and findings:

. Content Type Distribution: Number of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix.
. Release Trends: Year-wise release frequency — shows Netflix’s expansion.
. Regional Analysis: Titles produced or released in 'India' and the 'UK'.
. Top Directors: Identified the most prolific Netflix contributors.
. Actor Spotlight: Movies featuring 'Tom Cruise'.
. Genre & Rating Patterns: Distribution of categories and rating types.

Example visuals from the notebook include:

. Bar charts for 'content distribution and release years'.
. Countplots showing 'category breakdowns' using Seaborn.

 📈 Key Insights

. Movies make up the majority of Netflix’s catalog, though **TV Shows** are growing steadily.
. The 'early 2020s' show a spike in global releases.
. 'India' and the **UK** remain strong contributors of Netflix Originals.
